Ballpark Delivery

The Ballpark Delivery app allows fans to easily order their 
favorite foods during the game without missing a play.

They are provided with an intuitive iOS app within which 
they select the restaurant from which they want to eat 
and are subsequently provided with the restaurant's 
available menu.  After selecting the food that they desire, 
the selection is then sent to the appropriate restaurant. 
The user afterwards is presented with an ETA of the food.  
While still engaged in the game, the order will arrive to 
the user, who can enjoy the game without leaving 
his/her seat.
